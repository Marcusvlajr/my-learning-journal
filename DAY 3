# Day 3: Exploring APIs

## **API Fundamentals**
- Learned about API fundamentals, including HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Used **Cursor AI** to help me understand how APIs work.

## **Testing APIs with Postman**
- Installed **Postman** to test APIs.
- Tested a public API (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).
- Sent GET requests and analyzed the responses.

## **Created a Workflow in n8n**
- Built a workflow in n8n to fetch and process data from a public API:
  - Used the **HTTP Request Node** to fetch data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.
  - Added a **Code Node** to process the data (e.g., extract specific fields).
  - Saved the processed data to a file using the **Write to File Node**.

## **Next Steps**
- Fix the **Write to File Node** issue.
- Explore more n8n nodes and workflows.
- Document my progress as I continue learning.
