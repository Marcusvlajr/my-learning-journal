# Day 4: Exploring OpenAI and Prompt Engineering

## **OpenAI API Setup**
- Created an **OpenAI API account**.
- Generated my **API key** and understood the rate limits.

## **n8n OpenAI Node**
- Read the [n8n OpenAI node guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/).
- Created a simple **text completion workflow** using the OpenAI node:
  - Used the **OpenAI Node** to generate text completions.
  - Tested the workflow with different prompts.

## **Prompt Engineering**
- Read the [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).
- Experimented with different prompts and observed the outputs.
- Learned how to craft effective prompts for better results.

## **Next Steps**
- Explore more advanced OpenAI workflows (e.g., chat completions, fine-tuning).
- Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques.
- Document my progress as I continue learning.
