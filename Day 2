# Day 2: Deepening My Knowledge

## **Learning the Basics of Code**
- Spent 30 minutes learning the basics of code using **cursor.sh**.
- Followed a **15-minute block plan** to stay focused and productive.

## **n8n Concepts**
- Read about n8n concepts, including nodes, workflows, and triggers.
- Learned how to monitor websites using n8n.

## **Built a Website Monitoring Workflow**
- Created a workflow in n8n to monitor a website:
  - Used the **HTTP Request Node** to check the websiteâ€™s status.
  - Added a **Condition Node** to send an alert if the website is down.
  - Tested the workflow and verified it works.

## **Next Steps**
- Fix the **Write to File Node** issue.
- Explore more n8n nodes and workflows.
- Document my progress as I continue learning.
